## About The Project   
Making journaling fun and effortless through voice

### 1.1 Project Description 
**REVERB** is a mobile audio journaling app that empowers users to capture their thoughts, emotions, and reflections through voice recordings. It simplifies the journaling process by allowing users to record, tag moods, associate songs, and create meaningful audio entries that can be revisited over time.

Built with React Native and Expo for a smooth, cross-platform mobile experience, REVERB focuses on:

- **Audio Recording:** High-quality, easy-to-use recording features with a dynamic UI.  
- **Song Association:** Users can search and associate songs with their entries to enhance emotional context.  
- **Mood Tracking:** Attach moods and reflections to each recording for holistic journaling insights.  
- **Timeline & Playback:** Easily browse and play back past recordings via an intuitive timeline.

REVERB helps users connect with their memories and emotions in a seamless, engaging way.
